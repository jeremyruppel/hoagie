# hoagie

**hoagie** provides a nice way to organize your command-line applications into subcommands. Hoagie leverages npm to greatly simplify the creation of git-style subcommand apps, like 37signals' [sub]. It is language-agnostic and does not parse arguments for you, so you can write your subcommands in whatever language you want.

**Features:**

- [x] language agnostic
- [x] argv parser agnostic
- [x] find commands in `PATH`
- [x] list commands
- [x] help command
- [x] version command
- [ ] rc file support?
- [ ] man pages support?
- [x] colors!
- [x] suggest commands like git
